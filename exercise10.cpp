/*
 Write a program that is able to compute some operations on an integer. 
 The program writes the value of the integer and writes the following menu :
 
 1. Add 1
 2. Multiply by 2
 3. Subtract 4
 4. Quit
 
 The programs ask the user to type a value between 1 and 4. If the user types a value 
 from 1 to 3 the operation is computed, the integer is written and the menu is displayed again.
 If the user types 4, the program quits.
