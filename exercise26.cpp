/*
 Write a program that asks the user to input 5 sequences of characters. Then it will ask the user 
 for a character to search for and will output the maximum number of times that it occurred between 
 the 5 sequences. Example: Sequence 1: aabc Sequence 2: aaaa If the user chooses to search for 
 character 'a', the program will output "Character a occurred a maximum of 4 times" because it
 occurred 4 times in the second sequence, and only twice in the first sequence.
